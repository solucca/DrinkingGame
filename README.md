# Untitled Boose Game
This repository hosts the files of a drinking game developed for **Android** and **IOS** using **Xamarin**. 
The game is **heavily** inspired by **iPuke**, but with a few modifications on the rules and new cards and events.

# Rules

The rules are simple, the first player to reach te specified amount of points wins.
Each player takes turns taking cards from the deck, depending on the card some effect will happen.
Here are the cards:

## Challenge Card
The card contains a challenge and a number of shots.
If the player completes the challenge they receive the points.
The player can also drink the specified amount of shots to get additional points.
Of course it is also possible to drink without doing the challenge.

## Random event
This card affects all players. Follow the instructions of the card. For example:
"All single players drink!"

## Game Card
The players now have to play one round of the specified game:

- Never have I ever
- Truth or Dare
- Two truths and one lie

# Waring
This game was created by dumb teenagers and should not be taken too seriously. More than anything it was used as a tool to learn Xamarin, but I hope that one day the game can become something fun to play. 
Also remember:
**NEVER DRINK AND DRIVE**
